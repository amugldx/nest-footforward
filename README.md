# FootForward

FoodForward is an ecommerce application api where you can upload pictures of new shoes and sell them as admin. It is a complete api that an ecommerce store need for it to function. It has authentication but it lacks payment gateway. I am planning to implement it in the future.

This api is made using Nestjs, Prisma, Postgres, Cloudinary, Jwt, Docker and Swagger.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```
